\section{Development Process}

The scope of the Hog programming language was ambitious from the start. Our
stated goal was to create a general-purpose scripting language designed around
the Hadoop MapReduce framework. As such, from the beginning we were interested
in ways to make the implementation of the language as simple as possible.


To be written by Sam.

\begin{itemize}
\item State what process used was used to develop the language and its translator.
\item State the roles and responsibilities of each team member.
\item Include the implementation style sheet used by the team.
\item Show the timeline of what was done and when.
\item Include your project log.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Language Evolution}
\label{chap:evo}

To be written by Paul.

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe how the language evolved during the implementation and what steps were used to try to maintain the good attributes of the original language proposal.
\item Describe the compiler tools used to create the compiler components.
\item Describe what unusual libraries are used in the compiler.
\item Describe what steps were taken to keep the LRM and the compiler consistent.
\end{itemize}
