# Hog

Hog is a data-oriented, high-level, scripting language for created MapReduce programs used with Hadoop for distributed
computation. It provides users with an intuitive interface designed to allow users to focus on _what_ computations they want
done, and not _how_ to do them. Built on top of the Hadoop framework, Hog takes care of the low-level details required to run
computation on Hadoopâ€™s distributed network. All a user needs to do is run their Hog scripts on a computer with access to a valid
Hadoop instance, and Hog will do the rest.
